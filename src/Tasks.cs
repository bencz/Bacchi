/** \file
 *  Main task list (to-do list).
 *
 *  \todo Fix the problem that parameter names are \b not entered into the symbol table.

 *  \todo Take the address of \c ref arguments when passing them into the called procedure.
 *  \todo If an assignment goes to a \c ref argument, prefix it with asterisk (*).
 *  \todo Clean up partially redundant definitions of \c TupleDefinition and \c TupleType.
 *  \todo Eliminate \c symbols parameter from \c Equal() and rename \c Equal() to \c Compare().
 *  \todo Add a recursive \c Compare() method that compares two sub-trees recursively.
 *  \todo Create a list of all the things I've learned from this project for Alexandre.
