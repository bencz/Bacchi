# Bacchi #
Compiler development based in GCL syntax (GUARDED COMMAND LANGUAGE).

# Notes #
This implementation deviates from the standard definition in the following ways:

1. Definitions only allow a single identifier so it is **not** possible to define multiple variables in a single definition in the `definitionPart` of a `module` or a `block`.

# Usability #
Bacchi does **NOT** work yet!  It barely runs, but only barely so.  It cannot parse the sample yet.
